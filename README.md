# Overview
Create a web page that will allow users to select a currency from a dropdown list, and show the exchange rates of that currency with other currencies.

The list of available currencies should come from the database. You need to store the following currencies in database:
Indian Rupee (INR)
Australian Dollar (AUD)
Canadian Dollar (CAD)
Japanese Yen (JPY)

To show the exchange rates of the selected currency with other currencies, consume the suitable API of Foreign exchange rates on the web page to show the exchange rates received in APIâ€™s response.

You can either integrate the mentioned API directly in the web page, or make the web page hit a backend service in Django that internally calls this API and returns data to the web page.
